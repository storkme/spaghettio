# Phase F — In-place SAT-zone editor + fixture quality harness

Status: planned, fresh session pickup.
Depends on: Phase E v1 (fixture schema + test harness), landed on `main`.

## Goal

Build a corpus of hand-crafted SAT-zone fixtures, each pairing a real
problem instance (taken from a running layout) with a reference
solution the user considers "good." The solver is regression-tested
against this corpus on three axes: correctness (finds a solution at
all), quality (cost is at least as good as the reference), and
performance (total solve-time across the corpus doesn't drift).

The editor that produces these fixtures lives *in the existing web
app's PIXI canvas* — there is no separate `/fixture-builder` route.
Editing happens in place on the selected SAT zone, reusing the app's
entity rendering, viewport, and SAT overlay. The user spends their
time painting belts, not context-switching between views.

## Why this shape

### Use the existing canvas

We already render belts, UGs, splitters with direction + carries +
tier. Rebuilding that in a dedicated editor route duplicates code and
loses the surrounding context (the user can't see why the zone is
interesting if they're looking at it on a blank canvas). An "edit
mode" toggle on the selected zone costs ~60% less code than Phase F
as originally sketched.

### Reuse `solution_cost()` for quality

`crates/core/src/bus/junction_cost.rs` already defines the canonical
quality metric: belt=1, UG-in=5, UG-out=5. It's the same function the
solver's internal cost-descent loop minimises against. Using it for
fixture quality assertions keeps test and solver aligned — if the
solver's internal notion of "good" diverges from the test's notion of
"good," cost-descent would chase the wrong target.

### Factorio-grade drag mechanics

Painless editing is load-bearing. If the editor is clunky, the corpus
never grows. The bar: place a 12-tile belt run + auto-UG over an
obstacle in under 5 seconds. The rest of the fixture infrastructure
is worthless without this.

## Slices

### F1 — Rust SAT-with-pins API + WASM binding

Expose a SAT-with-pins entry point so the editor can ask "given my
painted entities as forced assumptions, complete a valid layout."
This is the engine for both the live validity indicator and the
ghost-completion overlay in F2.

New Rust function in `crates/core/src/sat.rs`, alongside
`solve_crossing_zone_with_stats`:

```rust
pub fn solve_crossing_zone_with_pins(
    zone: &CrossingZone,
    pins: &[PlacedEntity],
    max_ug_reach: u32,
    belt_tier: &str,
    max_ug_ins: Option<u32>,
) -> (Option<Vec<PlacedEntity>>, CrossingZoneStats)
```

Implementation: build the existing CNF encoding for `zone`, then
for each `PlacedEntity` in `pins` look up the SAT variable for the
(tile, entity-kind, direction) tuple and pass it as a varisat
assumption (positive literal). Pins outside the bbox or on
forbidden tiles cause an early-return `(None, stats)` so the
caller knows the pins were ill-formed. The decoded result includes
the pinned entities + any solver-added ones; the caller diffs
against `pins` to identify what SAT contributed.

Also factor `Fixture` / `FixtureExpected` / `FixtureBoundary` /
`build_zone` out of `crates/core/tests/sat_fixtures.rs` into a
public `crates/core/src/fixture.rs` so the test harness, the WASM
binding, and the editor share one schema. While doing the
extraction, add `max_cost: Option<u32>` to `FixtureExpected` and
wire the assertion described in the F2 §Test-harness update below.

New WASM binding in `crates/wasm-bindings/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn solve_fixture(
    fixture_json: &str,
    pins_json: &str, // serialised Vec<PlacedEntity>; "[]" for unpinned solve
) -> Result<JsValue, JsError> {
    // parse fixture + pins, call solve_crossing_zone_with_pins,
    // return { entities, cost, stats } or null
}
```

Consumed by `web/src/engine.ts`:

```ts
solveFixture(
  json: string,
  pins: PlacedEntity[],
): Promise<{ entities: PlacedEntity[]; cost: number; stats: SatStats } | null>
```

#### Acceptance

- [ ] `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --manifest-path crates/wasm-bindings/Cargo.toml` produces a bundle with the new export
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` in `web/` clean after the `engine.ts` method is added
- [ ] Unit test: pin a known belt from `sample_electronic_circuit.json`'s solution, expect SAT to return a solution including it; pin a belt at a forbidden tile, expect `None`
- [ ] Smoke check: feed `sample_electronic_circuit.json` to `solveFixture` with empty pins, assert a non-null result with `cost == 2` (two surface belts)

### F2 — Edit mode on the existing canvas

The inline panel's toolbar gains an "Edit" button (`✎` glyph). Clicking
enters edit mode for the currently-selected SAT zone's bbox.

#### State transitions

```
view mode        —[click Edit]→       edit mode
edit mode        —[Esc or Done]→      view mode
edit mode        —[click another zone]→  view mode (prompt to discard if dirty)
```

Edit mode is modal *within* the already-modal zone view. Clear visual
cue is mandatory: title bar of the inline panel shifts colour (yellow
tint?), cursor changes on the canvas, edit toolbar appears. No
ambiguity about which mode the user is in.

#### Canvas behaviour in edit mode

- **Entity layer dims further** (0.35 → 0.2 or so) so painted entities
  stand out against the existing stamp. The SAT overlay (bbox outline,
  boundary bars, forbidden hatch) stays at full brightness.
- **Painted entities render on a new layer** above the dimmed entity
  layer, using the existing entity renderer so they look identical to
  "real" belts. The layer is a writable working copy seeded from the
  current in-bbox entities.
- **Cursor** shows a ghost-preview of the current tool + direction at
  the hovered tile. Red tint if the placement would land on a
  boundary/forbidden tile.
- **Scope**: only tiles inside the selected bbox are editable. Hovering
  outside the bbox greys the cursor. Boundaries and forbidden tiles
  refuse placement.

#### Toolbar

Compact horizontal strip, bottom of the canvas or top of the inline
panel (decide at impl time based on screen real estate). Contents:

- Tool selector: Belt / UG-in / UG-out / Splitter / Erase
- Brush direction: N/E/S/W indicator, rotatable via `R`
- Item override: dropdown populated from the bbox's boundary items
  (painted belts carry this)
- Actions: Accept completion, Revert, Export Fixture, Done

Hotkeys mirror the toolbar plus muscle-memory shortcuts:

- `1/2/3/4/0` — tool select (belt/UG-in/UG-out/splitter/erase)
- `R` — rotate brush, AND while dragging, toggle the L-shape bend direction
- `Q` — pipette; pick the tool + direction from the tile under cursor
- `[` / `]` — prev/next item in the fixture's boundary item list
- `Enter` (or `A`) — accept the SAT-suggested ghost completion (only valid when the live indicator is green)
- `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` — undo / redo (in-memory stack; lost on reload)
- `Esc` — exit edit mode (prompt to discard unsaved changes)

#### Drag-to-paint

The core interaction. Must feel Factorio-tight.

1. **Mousedown** at tile A: record A, enter drag state, hide static
   cursor ghost.
2. **Mousemove** to tile B: compute an L-shaped path from A to B using
   the current "bend direction" (default: horizontal-first).
3. **Preview** the path as ghost entities — belts in brush direction,
   auto-forming UGs where the path crosses an obstacle (see below).
4. **R during drag**: toggle the bend direction (horizontal-first ↔
   vertical-first). Preview redraws.
5. **Mouseup**: commit the previewed entities to the edit layer. If
   any part of the path is invalid (refused UG, out-of-bounds), the
   whole placement fails and nothing commits — we don't want
   partial commits that leave the user confused.

#### Auto-UG over obstacles

This is the killer feature. The belt tier gives us `max_reach` (from
`common::ug_max_reach(belt_name)`). While painting a run:

1. Walk the L-shape tile-by-tile in drag order.
2. Classify each tile:
   - **Free**: placeable as a belt in the drag direction.
   - **Obstacle**: forbidden tile, or occupied by a non-belt permanent
     entity (splitter, machine, pole, pipe), or a boundary tile for a
     different item.
3. Partition the path into runs of consecutive Free tiles separated
   by runs of consecutive Obstacle tiles.
4. Each Obstacle run becomes a UG pair: UG-in at the last Free tile
   before the run, UG-out at the first Free tile after. The
   intervening Obstacle tiles stay untouched (we don't place anything
   on them — they're the tunnel interior).
5. Constraint: the distance from UG-in to UG-out must be ≤
   `max_reach + 1`. If an Obstacle run is too long to tunnel under,
   the whole drag fails and previews red. Split the Obstacle run into
   multiple pairs if there are intermediate Free tiles — multiple
   consecutive UG pairs is fine as long as each individual tunnel is
   within reach.

Edge cases:

- Drag ending inside an Obstacle run: refuse — needs a Free tile for
  the UG-out.
- Drag starting on an Obstacle: refuse — needs a Free tile for the
  UG-in.
- Obstacle run of length 0 (i.e. no obstacles): just a belt run, no
  UGs needed.

#### Continuous validation + ghost completion

The editor doesn't ping-pong on a hotkey. Instead it runs a
two-tier validity check on every edit and renders SAT's chosen
completion of the user's paint as a ghost overlay. This means the
user can paint a partial spine (e.g. trunk + UGs) and immediately
see how SAT would fill in the rest — the dominant pain today is
non-straight tap-offs, and the user can solve them neatly by
hand-placing the spine and letting SAT do the awkward bits.

**Tier 1 — TS-side structural** (sub-ms, runs synchronously on
every edit / drag-commit):

- All painted entities inside the bbox.
- No painted entity on a `forbidden` tile.
- No two painted entities at the same `(x, y)`.
- All UG-in / UG-out pairs match (same direction axis, same item,
  within `max_reach + 1` apart, no other UG pair of the same item
  between them).

If Tier 1 fails: status indicator goes red, reason is recorded for
hover-tooltip use, no SAT call dispatched.

**Tier 2 — SAT-with-pins** (debounced ~300ms after the last edit;
only fires if Tier 1 passed):

1. Status indicator flips to amber (solving).
2. Serialise the current painted layer + the fixture JSON (same
   shape as Phase E export).
3. Call `engine.solveFixture(json, paintedEntities)` from F1. The
   web side passes the painted entities as SAT *assumptions* —
   varisat must produce a satisfying assignment that includes
   every painted belt/UG.
4. **SAT** → status green; render `entities \ paintedEntities` as
   a ghost-style overlay (lower alpha + outline tint) showing what
   SAT would add to complete the layout. Cost shown next to the
   indicator.
5. **UNSAT** → status red, reason "SAT cannot complete this
   layout". Common while the user is mid-paint (the in/out path
   isn't connected yet). The reason is hidden by default — hover
   the indicator to see it.

In-flight SAT requests are superseded by newer edits via a
request-id epoch (cancel-on-stale).

#### Accept ghost completion

When the indicator is green, the toolbar's **Accept** button (or
hotkey `Enter` / `A`) promotes the ghost overlay into the painted
layer in one undo-able step. After accepting, the painted layer is
already a complete SAT solution — there are no more ghosts to show
and `your cost == solver cost`.

#### Validity indicator + disabled actions

A small status dot lives in the inline panel head next to the
title:

- 🟢 valid · cost {N} / yours {M}
- 🟡 solving…
- 🔴 invalid

Hovering the dot surfaces the failure reason as a tooltip. Mid-
paint UNSAT is the common case (e.g. "belt not connected"), so
showing the reason in the panel chrome by default is too noisy —
the dot stays compact and the user reaches for it only when they
care.

While the indicator is not green, **Export Fixture**, **Copy
fixture JSON**, and **Accept completion** are all disabled. The
fixture would otherwise fail its own check on first test run — it's
cheaper to block at source than after a failing CI run.

This closes the loop — the user paints partial layouts, watches
SAT propose completions in real time, accepts them when good,
iterates when not. Key insight: SAT is a co-pilot filling gaps, not
an opponent producing alternative solutions.

#### Export Fixture

Toolbar "Export" button (or `E`):

1. Gather the painted entities (the edit layer).
2. Compute `max_cost = solution_cost(painted_entities)` via a web-side
   reimplementation matching `junction_cost.rs` (or expose a WASM
   helper — cheap call).
3. Build fixture JSON with all the existing fields (bbox, forbidden,
   belt_tier, boundaries, context.ghost_paths) plus:
   ```json
   "expected": {
     "mode": "solve",
     "max_cost": <computed>
   },
   "painted": {
     "entities": [ /* user's painted entities, for human reference */ ]
   }
   ```
4. Copy JSON to clipboard + download as `<name>.json`. Default name
   prompts the user.

`painted.entities` is informational — the test harness doesn't compare
against it. It's for future humans reading the fixture to see what the
author intended.

#### Test-harness update (minor)

`crates/core/tests/sat_fixtures.rs` gains one assertion for the new
quality axis:

```rust
if let Some(max_cost) = fixture.expected.max_cost {
    let actual_cost = solution_cost(&entities);
    if actual_cost > max_cost {
        failures.push(format!(
            "{name}: solver cost {actual_cost} exceeds fixture max_cost {max_cost}"
        ));
    }
}
```

The `max_cost: Option<u32>` field is added to `FixtureExpected`
when it moves into the shared `crates/core/src/fixture.rs` module
in F1. When absent (all current fixtures), no quality assertion —
only the mode-based check runs.

#### F2 acceptance

- [ ] Edit button enters edit mode, Esc/Done exits cleanly
- [ ] Drag-to-paint a straight horizontal belt run lays belts in drag direction
- [ ] Drag with an L-bend, R toggles bend direction live
- [ ] Drag over a 2-tile obstacle auto-forms a UG pair at the boundary
- [ ] Drag over a 10-tile obstacle with yellow belts (max_reach=4) refuses + flashes red
- [ ] Live indicator goes green within ~300ms of a valid edit; ghost layer outlines SAT's chosen completion
- [ ] Hovering a red indicator surfaces the failure reason; the reason is hidden otherwise
- [ ] Accept (button or Enter) promotes the ghost layer into the painted layer in one undo-able step
- [ ] Export / Copy / Accept buttons are disabled while the indicator is not green
- [ ] `Ctrl+Z` restores previous state (including post-Accept)
- [ ] Export produces a fixture JSON that re-loads via Phase E's test harness
- [ ] Fixture with `expected.max_cost` set fails the test if solver exceeds it, passes if solver matches or beats it

## What this unlocks

Once F1 + F2 land, the workflow is:

1. Run the app, spot a zone where SAT's output looks wasteful.
2. Click the zone → Edit → paint the parts you care about (often the
   trunk + UGs you want straight).
3. Live indicator turns green within ~300ms; ghost overlay shows
   how SAT would complete the rest. Accept if good, paint more if
   not.
4. Export → drop the JSON in `crates/core/tests/sat_fixtures/`.
5. `cargo test sat_fixtures` locks the bar in. If a future solver
   change increases cost on that zone, CI catches it.

Over time the corpus becomes a quality + performance benchmark we can
evaluate encoder tweaks against. The flywheel matters more than any
individual fixture.

## Open questions deferred to impl

- **Undo stack persistence**: in-memory is fine for v1. Serialise to
  session storage if it proves painful.
- **Multi-zone editing**: edit mode is single-zone. No plans for
  cross-zone editing — fixtures are scoped to a single SAT zone by
  design.
- **Fixture renaming**: users will want to rename after export. Leave
  that to the user's file manager; the browser download can default
  to the auto-generated name.
- **Version bump of fixture schema**: F2 adds `expected.max_cost` and
  `painted`. Both optional, schema stays at `version: 1`. Bump to 2
  only if a breaking change is introduced later.

## Not in scope for Phase F

- Benchmarking harness (per-fixture solve-time tracking + trend
  reports). Separate task — covered by the performance axis in intent
  but the timing infra is a different build-out.
- Batch fixture editing tools (bulk regenerate, diff two fixtures,
  etc.). Wait for the corpus to actually need these.
- Fixture sharing via URL (hash-encoded fixture in a shareable link).
  Nice but not load-bearing; skip until someone asks for it.
