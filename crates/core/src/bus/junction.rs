//! Junction types for the next-generation ghost routing resolution.
//!
//! See `docs/archive/rfp-junction-solver.md`. A Junction is an abstract region where
//! two or more ghost-routed specs cross and need a deterministic resolution
//! (surface + underground belt arrangement).
//!
//! Currently used as the internal shape for ghost-router "unresolved"
//! junctions (per-tile 1×1 crossings that still need a template). The
//! junction is built first, then lowered to a `LayoutRegion` via
//! `to_layout_region` at the output boundary. A solver pass that actually
//! consumes `Junction` will land in a follow-up.
//!
//! Invariants:
//! - Each spec contributes exactly **1 entry + 1 exit**. No splitting or
//!   merging happens inside a junction — that's handled by pre-placed
//!   infrastructure (row templates, balancers, mergers).
//! - For each `(item, belt_tier)` tuple, `#inputs == #outputs` — flow is
//!   conserved by class.
//! - `forbidden` tiles inside the bbox are not routable (machines, poles,
//!   inserters, row template belts, pre-placed balancer entities, etc.).
//!   A strategy must not place belts on forbidden tiles.
//! - The `bbox` is the tight enclosing rectangle of the junction's routable
//!   area; strategies can assume any tile in `bbox \ forbidden` is free.
